文明6用的是PBR模型，用于写实风格。

**BaseColor**
Often also called Albedo, it is simply the color of the material you are trying to represent. Gold is yellow, stone is grey, etc. Pretty simple. Something to note for people from civ 5 though. These the color should purely represent surface color. There normally is no need to include any shading detail on these maps as you might have done in civ 5.
反射率，代表物体最本质的颜色，不需要任何光影。

**Ambient Occlusion/AO**
The reason that shading info isn't needed anymore is because of Ambient Occlusion. Before this information used to be combined into the Albedo and Specular maps, but it is now handled separately. AO is a map that represents how much light the model would be exposed to if it were lit with even ambient light. Bake it out from Blender/Maya/3Ds or just use a pure white map.
环境光遮蔽，表示曝光程度

**Metalness**
How metal something is: in terms of the material that is. So gold is 100% metal (pure white), and paper is 100% not (pure black). Normally stick to only black and white with no grays. Sometimes metalness is used to simulate the look of certain fabrics, such as silk, which is what I'm doing here, hence the gray where the purple is in the Albedo.

**Glossiness**
Glossiness represents the smoothness of the microsurface of a material. So a chrome ball is completely smooth (white) and something like dirt is much rougher (black). So you can see my here armour is smoother than my cloth. I've attached a chart to give an idea of value ranges. Some of us may be more familiar with Roughness maps: simply invert that to get a Glossiness.

**Normal**
This represents smaller changes in the surface of material. Think dents, dings and small crevices. It's a theoretically more complex map to explain, but suffice it to say that it uses the RGB colors to store where the material should deviate from the actual geometric surface of the mesh.

This is a hard map to make by hand, and it's best to rely on other tools like: CrazyBump, Bit2Map, AwesomeBump (this is the free one), to generate it from a height map. For most cases in Civ 6, you should be able to get away with a map is is a solid 128,128,255 in color (representing a completely flat surface).

All this can end up being a little hard to do purely in Photoshop, but you shouldn't have a problem if all you're doing is models for buildings and units. If you do hope to eventually work on 3D leaderheads however (if and when we figure that out), you may want to look into tools used specifically for texturing 3D models, most notably Substance Painter and Quixel. I personally recommend the former.

If you're interested, here's an article that goes into much more detail on the ideas behind PBR. My intro here is essentially a condensed version of that, summarising a lot of stuff and leaving out the bits not relevant to Civ 6.​

# Defining the Artdefines
@Leugi

* UnitBins -> UnitMembers -> Unit 
Bins 相当于一个文件夹用于存放身体的零部件
Members 就是一个单位的成员。比如弓箭手有3个成员

* Unit_Bins 中 UnitAttachmentBins 的结构
Bin Name > Groups > Group Name > Cultures > CultureName > Assets
Vehicles > Groups > Tank > Cultures > Any/Asian.. > Assets
Assets: 
- Name: TankA
- Asset: TANKA (这是 .ast 文件 或者它在 xlp 文件中的名字)
- Scale: 1
用的时候是用 **BinName/GroupName** 而不是 BinName/AssetName

*The Group points to the actual name that will be referenced later in the artdefine*
*If a Group has more than one asset they’ll be chosen randomly*

* UnitMemberTypes
Horseman > Cultures > Any/Asian/Africa.. > Variations > Horse/Rider > Attachments > Armor..

其中 Variations 下面是一个单独 member 的组成部分，比如 马+骑手。如果只有一个则一般设为A。


## 在XLP文件中
m_ClassName     Type of Asset to go in this library package
m_PackageName   Name of resulting .blp package file
m_EntryID       The entry to be referenced from .artdefs
m_ObjectName    Refers to Asset .ast file

**UnitAttachmentBins** links between the **UnitMemberTypes** (individual unit model definitions) and the attachment 3D object entries inside the .blp.

In the mod ArtDef, go to the "UnitAttachmentBins" root collection, and add an element. Once the new element has been created, **change its name to match the name in the Unit_Bins.artdef collection** (for example, if you are adding a generic melee weapon, change the attachment bin name to "Weapons").

If you want to completely replace the set of weapons that a unit uses instead of adding a new weapon that can be randomly selected, for each entry in the original bin, create a corresponding entry with the same name as the original entry. For each of these entries, select the asset that you want it to point to. These new entries will overwrite the original entries listed in the Unit_Bins.artdef file.




# Retexturing
.tex 文件包含了一个特定的 dds 文件
.mtl 文件包含了 BaseColor/Emissive/Gloss/Metalness/Normal 等 .tex 文件
.ast 文件的 Geometries 里面包含了 mtl 文件


For a Unit I need to implement six texture layers:

----

**BaseColor**

1) Lauch the Asset Editor from the Tools menu in ModBuddy.
2) Create a new document using either File > New or Ctrl-N or the document icon in the top left corner.
3) Pick "Texture"
4) Enter a sensible name for your texture for example "T34_Base_Texture"
5) Pick the Class Name "Generic_BaseColor" - this is the type of texture you want to make.
5) To the left of Source File Path navigate to your source .dds and select it.
6) Save using Ctrl-S or the disk icon. This will create both the .tex Texture metadata file and an amended copy of your .dds file within the ModBuddy projects Textures folder.

**Normal** (can be defaulted to 4x4 image of RGB(128,128,255))

The Normal texture is basically a way of adding more 3D detail to model using a 2D image file. This Normal Map Online web application is great tool both for understanding how Normal maps and creating them from greyscale images.

A RGB value of (128,128,255) corresponds to flat, so if you don't want to bother actively using this layer you can just create a 4x4 image of this color and save to .dds (4x4 is the smallest size a .dds file can be and can be used for any single color textures to save filesize). Once you have your flatNormal_4x4.dds saved you can create your .tex and .dds pairing as before using the Asset Editor this time selecting the Class Type "Generic_Normal".

If you want to make a proper Normal texture then you can generate a crude one by like this:

1) Greyscale your base texture.
2) Smooth out any rough looking areas that you don't want to appear bumpy or paint over them with (128,128,128) grey.
3) Use the Normal Map Online tool to generate your Normal texture file before saving it as a .dds.
4) Create your .tex and .dds pairing as before using the Asset Editor this time selecting the Class Type "Generic_Normal".


**AO** (can be defaulted to a 4x4 image of white)

The Ambient Occlusion (AO) texture is a method to approximate how bright light should be shining on any specific part of a surface, based on the light and its environment (says the internet!). Essentially this is the shading layer - shading should really be left out of the base layer.

Although this can be defaulted to all white. Blender does have the in-built facility for baking 2D AO textures from 3D models which I've had some success with. (More later)


**Metalness** (can be defaulted to a 4x4 image of black)

The Metalness affects how reflections look on the reflective parts of the model. In the real world reflections in metal are more clear and sharp than reflections in other surfaces such as paint, wood, etc. Apparently the metal map should either use black or white - white for metal parts, black for non-metal parts. Grey areas are not advised. I haven't really played with this much yet but I guess it would only be used for naked steel and the like. Even for painted metal you wouldn't use this.

**Glossiness** (can be defaulted to a 4x4 image of black)

The Glossiness affects how reflective of lighting the different parts of the model are - white for completely reflective and black for completely non-reflective.

**TintMask** (can be defaulted to a 4x4 image of black)

The TintMask controls how much of the base Tint color shows through the base layer. You can think of it like an alpha mask where white=transparent and black=opaque. Using this you can make parts of your mesh re-colorable using the Tint colors in Units.artdef.


By the time you've made all the Textures you would have 12 files - one .tex and one corresponding .dds for each of the six Textures.

The Material file (.mtl file) can then be made to bring all these together. You can either make this using the Asset Editor or by making a copy of one of the vanilla .mtl files from the pantry.

Bear in mind that once you've made a .tex/.dds pair for Texture that can be reused in as many different materials as you like - especially useful for re-using black/white/flatNormal 4x4 textures.

----

## Geometries (.geo files)

The .fgx model and .geo Geometry metadata file can both be made using CivNexus6. You can add them into your mod using Add > Existing Item.

For Units people will mostly be rigging new meshes to existing skeletons/animations as with Civ 5/Civ 4.

The high level process for this is:
1) Load the model you want to base your new Unit on into CivNexus6.
2) Export the model to .nb2 format.
3) Load the model into Blender using the scripts.
4) Do whatever modeling (mesh import and adjustment) and rigging (assigning the vertices of the mesh to bone weights via vertex groups) you need to do in Blender.
5) Export to .cn6 format.
6) Either
(a) use Import to import your .cn6 file then Save to create your .fgx.
(b) make a copy of original source .fgx with a new name and then use Overwrite to replace all the mesh data in the .fbx with the mesh data from your .cn6 file. All skeleton data will be left intact.
7. You may need to rename, add, delete and/or reassign your Materials to Meshes inside CivNexus6. These names are referenced from within your .ast and .geo file.

You can create your Geometry metadata .geo file using the Save Geometry (.geo) file in the Additional Actions tab.

* For Blender tutorials, YouTube is your friend.
If you want to copy the bone weights/vertex groups (aka rigging) from one mesh to another (useful for e.g. human units) you can use the Transfer Weights method described in Wolfdog's tutorial here - note: only Steps 3 and 5-8 of that tutorial are relevant (unless you're importing Civ 4 meshes to Civ 6!).

If your model is relatively simple (.e.g. a tank or plane) then you can assign parts of the mesh to different bone vertex groups manually. Weight Paint mode in Blender can be really useful for checking the weights of vanilla models and for identifying any issues with weights in general.








## How much work to mod a fully animated leader?

Heya, this is from the perspective of a student animator that focuses on film, but it's quite a bit of a lengthy process. Also keep in mind I'm coming in from a background in modeling and animating characters on the slightly more abstract side as opposed to realistic. I'll break down the production pipeline below:

Research + Designing:
- One to two weeks of research related to personalities, literature, architecture, etc etc
- Two weeks to a month of designs and iterations (Many many many pages of sketches, you do NOT settle with the first design you like)
- ^ Above includes the character: Sketches, pose drawings (LOTS of them - T-poses are also a big no-no if you want to make your character look expressive on paper), environmental concept art, colour palettes
- 3D modeling can take around a month
- Rigging the skeleton for the model comes next - this creates a framework for the character's limbs to move
- HOWEVER, you need to 'skin' the character to the skeleton - this means making the geometry of your model's mesh react to the joints in your skeleton. This is done by sort of 'painting' areas of your mesh which you want to move according to the selected joints (it can be a complicated and frustrating affair for some, and others are just plain wizzards at fast and good skinning :crazyeye:)
- Next part is texturing which involves UV mapping (sort of like making the seams on clothing to allow you to paint specific areas for textures) and then making the textures themselves (this also includes different layers which can also effect the way the lights shine and reflect on a mesh, or even how the mesh renders in-game itself as well)
- Rigging, skinning and texturing is usually done at the same time by different people, but for one person it can take a a week or two
- Then after that, there are probably 2-3 weeks of just revising and fixing stuff (if you even have time)

Professionals would be quicker, especially since they can have multiple people filling these roles, though the place I study at tries to keep kinda close to a professional schedule (Although with the university itself sort of screwing us over recently, we've had less time to work on our films this year - but that's an OT story :p)

EDIT: TOTALLY forgot about the animation part. Depending on whether or not you want to match it up with dialogue, and considering you're technically animating just a few lines (and maybe some neutral poses + breathing, etc, etc) - it can range wildly based on how good and fast you are. Personally, for me, I think I'd take maybe a week minimum.







# CivNexus6
To use it you will need to have the Windows registry key
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Firaxis\Tools
ToolAssetPath set to any directory that contains two directories named "Assets" and "Resource".

.NET Framework 4 may also be required.


# Blender 
Q: IndexError: bpy_prop_collection[index]: index 0 out of range, size 0
A: It looks like one of your meshes is not parented to an armature (skeleton). See here. Right-click to select the mesh, and then right-click to select the Armature then key Ctrl-P to parent your mesh to the selected Armature.

Updated January 13, 2019
A texture map is a two-dimensional image file that can be applied to the surface of a 3D model to add color, texture, or other surface detail like glossiness, reflectivity, or transparency. Texture maps are developed to directly correspond to the UV coordinates of an unwrapped 3D model and are either devised from real-life photos, or hand painted in a graphics application like Photoshop or Corel Painter.


Texture maps are usually painted directly on top of the model's UV layout, which can be exported as a square bitmap image from any 3D software package. Texture artists usually work in layered files, with the UV coordinates on a semi-transparent layer that the artist will use as a guide for where to place specific details.

Color (or Diffuse) Maps
As the name would imply, the most obvious use for a texture map is to add color or texture to the surface of a model. This could be as simple as applying a wood grain texture to a table surface, or as complex as a color map for an entire game character (including armor and accessories).


However, the term texture map, as it's often used is a bit of a misnomer -- surface maps play a huge role in computer graphics beyond just color and texture. In a production setting, a character or environment's colormap is usually just one of three maps that will be used for almost every single 3D model.

The other two "essential" map types are specular maps and bump/displacement, or normal maps.

Specular Maps
Specular maps (also known as gloss maps). A specular map tells the software which parts of a model should be shiny or glossy, and also the magnitude of the glossiness. Specular maps are named for the fact that shiny surfaces, like metals, ceramics, and some plastics show a strong specular highlight (a direct reflection from a strong light source). If you're unsure about specular highlights, look for the white reflection on the rim of your coffee mug. Another common example of specular reflection is the tiny white glimmer in someone's eye, just above the pupil.

A specular map is typically a greyscale image and is absolutely essential for surfaces that aren't uniformly glossy. An armored vehicle, for example, requires a specular map in order for scratches, dents, and imperfections in the armor to come across convincingly. Similarly, a game character made of multiple materials would need a specular map to convey the different levels of glossiness between the character's skin, metal belt buckle, and clothing material.


Bump, Displacement, or Normal Map
A bit more complex than either of the two previous examples, bump maps are a type of texture map that can help give a more realistic indication of bumps or depressions on the surface of a model.

Consider a brick wall: An image of a brick wall could be mapped to a flat polygon plane and called finished, but chances are it wouldn't look very convincing in a final render. This is because a flat plane doesn't react to light the same way a brick wall would, with its cracks and coarseness.

To increase the impression of realism, a bump or normal map would be added to more accurately recreate the coarse, grainy surface of bricks, and heighten the illusion that the cracks between bricks are actually receding in space. Of course, it would be possible to achieve the same effect by modeling each and every brick by hand, but a normal mapped plane is much more computationally efficient. It's impossible to overstate the importance of normal mapping in the modern game industry -- games simply could not look the way they do today without normal maps.

Bump, displacement, and normal maps are a discussion in their own right and are absolutely essential for achieving photo-realism in a render. Be on the lookout for an article covering them in depth.

Other Map Types to Know
Aside from these three map types, there are one or two others you'll see relatively often:

Reflection Map: Tells the software which portions of the 3D model should be reflective. If a model's entire surface is reflective, or if the level of reflectivity is uniform a reflection map is usually omitted. Reflection maps are grayscale images, with black indicating 0% reflectivity and pure white indicating a 100% reflective surface.
Transparency Map: Exactly like a reflection map, except it tells the software which portions of the model should be transparent. A common use for a transparency map would be a surface that would otherwise be very difficult, or too computationally expensive to duplicate, like a chain link fence. Using a transparency, instead of modeling the links individually can be quite convincing as long as the model doesn't feature too close to the foreground, and uses far fewer polygons.

- Create and/or Edit Mod.Art.xml with correct relativeArtDefPaths and libraryDependencies
> You will need to add elements under consumerName Units and libraryName Unit
- Project Properties => In-Game Actions
=> ImportFiles (All your .dds, .tex, .geo, .anm, .mtl, .bhv, .ast, and any other art files you created.)
=> UpdateArt ((Mod Art Dependency File) and any .artdef files you created)
- Click File => Save All => Click Build => Build Project
- You do not need to add .xlp files, or the GeometrySet.xml to the Project Properties In-Game Actions
- Your .blp files are auto generated from your .xlp files, and your .dep file is also auto generated from your Mod.Art.xml at build time.
9) Troubleshoot (Asset Editor/Blender/ModBuddy)
- Open your model's .ast file, make sure your model is displaying properly in the Asset PreViewer panel
- If you can't see your model in Asset PreViewer, then there could be something wrong with your .ast file or any other file associated with it
- If you see it, but it is not the correct size or in the correct position, then its back to Blender to scale/rotate/repostion
> Then export to .cn6, do the same steps in CivNexus6, and copy/paste/replace the .fgx, .geo, and .xml to your Geometries folder in your ModBuddy Project
- Then open back up in Asset Editor to see if it is now correct
- If it is the start game up and see if it displays properly in game, if not, then there could be something wrong with your .xlp files, or Mod.Art.xml file, or .artdef files, or Project Properties
- Troubleshoot











NODE SETUPS AND CYCLES BAKING WITH PBR TEXTURES:

PBR Map Types:
- Color Map: Albedo/Base Color/Diffuse Map (different terms used) [The base color image of your texture]
- Ambient Occlusion Map: AO Map (different terms used) [Gives your texture shadows]
- Bump Map: Normal Map or Height Map/Displacement Map (usually one of the other, sometimes both) (Height Map/Displacement Map same thing) [Gives your texture depth and features]
- Glossiness: Gloss Map or Roughness Map (same, just inverted) [Gives your texture reflection]
> Specular Map: not needed for the Principled shader, used with a specular work flow [Tells the amount of light reflected]
> Reflection Map: not needed for the Principled shader, used with a specular work flow [Tells which parts of your texture has reflection]
- Metalness: Metallic Map (only used if your material is a metal) [Gives your texture a metallic look]
